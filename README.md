- This is the first project of my bootcamp. We are required to obtain data through either web scraping or an API. Once the data is collected, we need to clean and organize it through data wrangling.


Before this starting, you should have learnt about:

- Python Programming
- Introduction to Pandas DataFrames and Series
- Data Cleaning: handling null values and duplicates
- Data Formatting: dealing with strings, dates, renaming columns, using map, apply and mapapply methods
- Data structuring and combining data: methods such as pivot, stack/unstack or melt for data structuring and merge, concat or join for combining data.
- Data Aggregation: groupby and aggregation functions
